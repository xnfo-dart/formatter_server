  <h1>Formatter Server API Specification</h1>
  <h1 style="color:#999999">Version
    <version>0.6.2</version>
  </h1>
  <p>
    This document contains a specification of the API provided by the
    formatter server. The API in this document is currently under
    development. Changes to the API will be accompanied by an update to the
    protocol version number according to the principles of semantic
    versioning (<a href="https://semver.org/">semver.org</a>).
  </p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The formatter server API is a bi-directional client-server
    API. The API is independent of the transport mechanism used, but
    is heavily influenced by a model in which sockets or character
    streams are used to transport JSON-RPC encoded information.
  </p>
  <h3>Transport Mechanism</h3>
  <p>
    The characters passed to the server are expected to be encoded
    using UTF-8.
  </p>
  <p>
    When character streams are used as the transport, messages are
    delineated by newlines. This means, in particular, that the JSON
    encoding process must not introduce newlines within a
    message. Note however that newlines are used in this document
    for readability.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the client's responsibility to read output from the server to
    avoid its blocking.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ease interoperability with Lisp-based clients (which may not
    be able to easily distinguish between empty lists, empty maps,
    and null), client-to-server communication is allowed to replace
    any instance of "<tt>{}</tt>" or "<tt>[]</tt>" with null. The
    server will always properly represent empty lists as
    "<tt>[]</tt>" and empty maps as "<tt>{}</tt>".
  </p>
  <h3>Communication Structure</h3>
  <p>
    Clients can make a request of the server and the server will
    provide a response for each request that it receives. While many
    of the requests that can be made by a client are informational
    in nature, we have chosen to always return a response so that
    clients can know whether the request was received and was
    correct.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no guarantee concerning the order in which responses
    will be returned, but there is a guarantee that the server will
    process requests in the order in which they are sent as long as
    the transport mechanism also makes this guarantee. Responses can
    be returned in an order that is different from the order in
    which the requests were received because some requests take
    longer to process than others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every request is required to have two fields and may have two
    additional optional fields. The first required field is the ‘id’
    field, which is only used by the server to associate a response
    with the request that generated the response. The second
    required field is the ‘method’ field, which is used to determine
    what the server is being requested to do. One optional field is
    the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the method
    being requested. The structure of this field is described with
    each request for which it is required. The other optional field
    is the 'clientRequestTime' field, which is a number indicating
    the time at which the client made the request (milliseconds
    since epoch). Providing clientRequestTime helps us track
    how responsive formatter server is to client requests
    and better address any issues that occur.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every response has up to three fields. The first field is the
    ‘id’ field, which is always present and whose value is the
    identifier that was passed to the request that generated the
    response. The second field is the ‘error’ field, which is only
    present if an error was encountered while processing the
    request. The third field is the ‘result’ field, whose structure
    is dependent on the method being responded to, and is described
    with each request that will produce it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server can also communicate to the clients by sending a
    notification. The purpose of these notifications is to provide
    information to clients as it becomes available rather than to
    require that clients poll for it. Unless explicitly stated, all
    notifications are designed to return the complete information
    available at the time the notification is sent; clients are not
    required to update previously communicated
    results. Consequently, the server can and should return partial
    results before all results are available. For example, the
    syntactic errors for a file can be returned as soon as the
    syntactic analysis is complete, and both syntactic and semantic
    errors can be returned together at a later time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each notification has two fields. The first field is the ‘event’
    field, which identifies the kind of notification. The second
    field is the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the
    kind of notification being sent. The structure of this field is
    described with each notification.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to be backward compatible, clients should ignore fields that were
    not specified in the version of the API on which they were based. Clients
    should also use the server.getVersion request to test that the version of
    the server supports an API before using it.
  </p>
  <h3>Eventual Consistency</h3>
  <p>
    The formatter server satisfies requests under the principle of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual
      consistency</a>.
    That is, in some cases it may return responses with the currently available
    results while it's catching up with unprocessed changes.
  </p>
  <h3>Enumerations</h3>
  <p>
    Responses from the server may include enumerations indicating the kind of a
    specific item. The enums may be extended with new values in future versions of
    the server so clients should ensure unknown values are handled gracefully, either
    ignoring the item or treating it with some default/fallback handling.

          <p>
            This error is included for future expansion; at present
            the formatter server can only speak to one client at a
            time so this error will never occur.

          <p>

            not recognize, or cannot handle in its current
            configuration.
          </p>
        </value>
        <value>
          <code>UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE</code>

            which is not supported.

          <p>
            This is a legacy error; it will be removed before the
            API reaches version 1.0.
