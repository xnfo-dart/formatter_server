  <h1>Common Types</h1>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <p>
    This document contains a specification of the types that are common between
    the analysis server wire protocol and the analysis server plugin wire
    protocol. While those protocols are versioned, the common types are not
    versioned separately.
  </p>
  <p>
    When those protocols have identical definitions of a type, the type definition
    should be removed from the two individual specifications and added to this
    document. Two definitions of a type are identical if the HTML that defines the
    types is identical and if all of the types referenced by those two types are
    identical.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it becomes necessary to change the definition of a common type in one
    protocol such that the type will no longer be common, that type and any types
    that reference that type must be removed from this document and added to both
    of the documents that include this document.
  </p>
  <types>
    <type name="AddContentOverlay">
      <p>
        A directive to begin overlaying the contents of a file. The supplied
        content will be used for server requests in place of the file contents in the
        filesystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this directive is used on a file that already has a file content
        overlay, the old overlay is discarded and replaced with the new one.
      </p>
      <object>
        <field name="type" value="add">
          <ref>String</ref>
        </field>
        <field name="content">
          <ref>String</ref>
          <p>
            The new content of the file.
          </p>
        </field>
      </object>
    </type>
    <type name="ChangeContentOverlay">
      <p>
        A directive to modify an existing file content overlay. One or more ranges
        of text are deleted from the old file content overlay and replaced with
        new text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The edits are applied in the order in which they occur in the list. This
        means that the offset of each edit must be correct under the assumption
        that all previous edits have been applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an error to use this overlay on a file that does not yet have a file
        content overlay or that has had its overlay removed via
        <a href="#type_RemoveContentOverlay">RemoveContentOverlay</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any of the edits cannot be applied due to its offset or length being
        out of range, an <tt>INVALID_OVERLAY_CHANGE</tt> error will be reported.
      </p>

          <list>
            <ref>SourceEdit</ref>

          <p>
            The edits to be applied to the file.

        </field>
      </object>
    </type>
    <type name="RemoveContentOverlay">
      <p>
        A directive to remove an existing file content overlay. After processing
        this directive, the file contents will once again be read from the file
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this directive is used on a file that doesn't currently have a content
        overlay, it has no effect.
      </p>
      <object>
        <field name="type" value="remove">

        </field>

    </type>

    <type name="FilePath">
      <ref>String</ref>
      <p>
        The absolute, normalized path of a file.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the format of a file path in a request is not valid, e.g. the path is
        not absolute or is not normalized, then an error of type
        <tt>INVALID_FILE_PATH_FORMAT</tt> will be generated.
      </p>
    </type>

    <type name="Position">
      <p>
        A position within a file.

        <field name="offset">
          <ref>int</ref>
          <p>
            The offset of the position.

          </list>
          <p>

            applied.

          <ref>String</ref>
          <p>
            The optional identifier of the change kind. The identifier remains
            stable even if the message changes, or is parameterized.
          </p>
        </field>
      </object>
    </type>
    <type name="SourceEdit">

          <p>
            An identifier that uniquely identifies this source edit from other
            edits in the same response. This field is omitted unless a containing
            structure needs to be able to identify the edit for some reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, some refactoring operations can produce edits that might
            not be appropriate (referred to as potential edits). Such edits will
            have an id so that they can be referenced. Edits in the same response
            that do not need to be referenced will not have an id.
          </p>

      </object>
    </type>
    <type name="SourceFileEdit">

      <object>
        <field name="file">
          <ref>FilePath</ref>
          <p>
            The file containing the code to be modified.

        <field name="fileStamp" deprecated="true">
          <ref>long</ref>
          <p>
            The modification stamp of the file at the moment when the change was
            created, in milliseconds since the "Unix epoch". Will be -1 if the
            file did not exist and should be created. The client may use this
            field to make sure that the file was not changed since then, so it is
            safe to apply the change.
          </p>
